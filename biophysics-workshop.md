## Introduction

### What is biophysics?

* **Ask students:** What do you think of when you hear the word 'biophysics'?

Biophysics is (probably) all of those things! We think of biophysics as:
* Learning about the physical properties and behaviour of biological things
* Using tools from physics to answer questions about biological things

We will do two activities today that have to do with biology and physics.

### About us

Where we're from, and why we study biophysics.

# Part 1: physics in biology

Many biophysicists study the physical properties of biological systems. One property that physicists love is how materials interact with light.

## Polarization of light

* **Ask students:** How many of you have learned about 'polarization' before? For grades 6-8, probably few to none of them will have. If any raise their hand, ask them in what context: some examples of polarization they would have encountered are polarized sunglasses and polarized glasses for 3D movies.

There are two things about light that we need to know to figure out what's going on in this first activity. The first is about the polarization of light, and the second is that different colours of light behave differently when they go through materials.

### Polarization and the wave nature of light

Light often behaves like a wave, and it wiggles like a wave as it moves.
Different directions of vibration (called 'polarization') can be filtered out using a polarizing filter.
A polarizing filter is like a fence, and the light will get blocked if it isn't lined up in the same direction as the fence slats.

Pass the two polarizing filters around the room and instruct students to look through the filters at a light and rotate them.

Optional (untested): demonstrate polarization with an actual rope and a fence-like object - I have seen this done before, and it would be a very concrete way to get the point across. With the rope passing through a slit and one person holding each end, wave the rope in the direction of the slats and observe that the wave passes through to the other side. Then wave the rope perpendicular to the slit and observe that the wave doesn't pass through.

### How light travels through materials

Different colours of light travel differently they go through things - that's how a prism works, and why the sky is blue. Shorter wavelengths (like blue and purple) typically slow down more when they go into a material than longer wavelengths (like yellow and red).

Different polarizations of light also behave differently when they go through certain materials. Some materials slow down certain directions of polarization more than others, which makes the overall direction of polarization twist around.

## Experiment: chiral molecules

### Materials

* Chiral molecule examples: pairs of tetrahedral molecules with four unique atoms on the outside: each pair should be a molecule and its mirror image (obtained by switching two of the corners).

### Procedure

* **Ask students:** Look at your two hands. What is the same about them? What is different?
    * Possible answers: the fingerprints are different, the lines are different, the nails are different, the number and type of fingers is the same, they are mirror images.
* Pass around the chiral molecule examples to each group. **Ask stuents:** What is the same about these two molecules? What is different about them? Can you rotate them to make them both look the same?

Many biological molecules are asymmetric: they look different depending on their orientation.
This asymmetry can be observed through the polarization of light:
light travelling through a material can be rotated or phase-shifted
to a different polarization if the molecule has certain asymmetries.
Many molecules are like our hands: there are two versions, and one is the mirror image of the other. Imagine trying to put a right-handed glove on your left hand. Is it possible?  

## Chiral molecule activity variation

This is an optional longer version that allows students to explore more intuitively why it's surprising that biological molecules generally exist in only one chirality. This is untested.

### Materials

* Molecular model set with enough components for each student to make a tetrahedral molecule with the same four unique atoms on each corner.

### Procedure

* Explain to students how to put molecular models together. Instruct them to assemble a tetrahedron with four specific colours on the corners. They should only have five colours: a black atom with four holes, and four other colours, each with one hole.
* If showing an image of a tetrahedral molecule, do not show the colours of the corners, or if you want colours, use different colours than what they have.
* Once every student has assembled their molecule, get the entire group to sort them by chirality. This might be tricky, but could be aided by images of the two possible mirror images which they compare to their molecules. Another option is to instruct everyone to rotate their molecules so that a certain colour is on top and a certain colour is pointing away from them, then ask them the order of the two remaining colours.
* Draw a set of axes on the board to make a histogram. Label two categories on the x-axis: "left" and "right", or two other labels for the two mirror images (perhaps the two colours left over after rotating as above). Possibly ask the students to come up with names.
* Group by group, ask each group to report how many of each type they made, then add the totals to the histogram.

Students should observe that about half of each type got made, which is what happenes when you do a chemical reaction in the lab. But biology uses *enzymes*, which are like gloves: they only fit one hand.

## Demonstration: polarization and chiral molecules

### Materials

* Two large polarizing sheets (~10" x 10")
* One large beaker filled with water
* One large beaker filled with a solution of water and sucrose powder
* Optional: a chunk of calcite, glass, or plastic, possibly with some tape
* Optional: one large beaker filled with a solution of water and stevia
* Optional: one large beaker filled with a solution of water and artificial sweetener
* Overhead projector
* Optional: paper with a circle cut in it to mask the part of the projector not beneath the beaker
* Chiral molecule examples from chemistry set

### Objective

Students explore the effect of biological molecules on the polarization of light
by placing materials between two crossed polarizers. Certain materials will rotate
polarization, others not. Sucrose and water causes beautiful colours to appear as crossed polarizers are rotated.

### Procedure

* Place a polarizing filter on the projector surface. Place the paper shield over the first filter.
* Turn on the projector and turn off the room lights. Close blinds if possible - the darker, the better.
* Place the second filter on the projector parallel to the first. Rotate it slowly. **Ask students:** what do you see when the two filters are crossed (with nothing in between)? It should look quite dark, possibly grey. Encourage the students to observe what they actually see, not what they think they see - it's good to observe that not all light is completely blocked.
* Place a beaker filled with water on the first polarizer, and rotate the second on top of it. **Ask students:** does this look any different from before? Why does this look similar to when there was only air between the polarizers? Talk through what's happening to the light: first it goes through one polarizer, then through the glass beaker, then through the water, then through the second polarizer.
* Show the students the beaker with the sugar solution. For younger students, ask them to guess what's in the beaker - they will enjoy guessing.
* Place the beaker filled with sugar water between the polarizers. Slowly rotate the top polarizer. **Ask students:** what do you see as the polarizer is rotated? What do you see when the polarizers are completely crossed?
* Call the students up, group by group, to look directly at the beaker through the polarizers. For this part it's important to block the rest of the projector light so that it's not too bright. While the students are coming up, here are some suggestions for things to ask them or say.

    * **Ask students**: what do you think would happen if we put more sucrose in the water? What about if we added more water? Both?
    * Interesting fact: when we smell, our bodies sense the 3D shape of molecules like a lock and key. This means that some molecules actually smell different depending on which mirror image they are because they're shaped differently. The molecule [carvone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carvone) smells like spearmint, but the mirror image smells like caraway!
    * Interesting fact: the same principle of using asymmetric molecules to interact with light is how LCDs (liquid crystal displays) work!

## Polarization experiment debrief

* **Ask students:** where does sugar come from? How is it made? (By plants, from sunlight and air)

Many biological molecules (molecules created or altered by a living creature), are *chiral* or *asymmetric* - their mirror image is not the same.

In many cases, the mirror image molecule can exist, but it might have a completely different function! For example, the two components of sucrose, glucose and fructose, are both chiral as well. We can only digest one of the two versions of glucose: we can digest D-glucose and D-fructose, but L-glucose and L-fructose taste sweet but we are not digestible.

* **Ask students**: how do you think this concept could be used to investigate materials?
* Interesting fact: this technique is used in the sugar industry to measure sugar concentration!

DNA is a biological molecule, and its structure was unknown until the 1950s.
Researchers (Rosalind Franklin) used light to analyze the structure of DNA and
realized that DNA had a double-helix structure.

# Part 2 - randomness in nature

* **Ask students:** what are some things that you know about DNA? What does it do?

Before we knew about the structure of DNA and that DNA carried genetic information,
people learned things about how inheritance worked by observing its effects in
natural populations.

When we look around at the diversity of life, it looks very complicated and hard to understand: why are elephants big? Why do zebras have stripes? Why are there so many kinds of grass?  We know that evolution governs some of the change that happens in natural populations, but does 'surival of the fittest' tell the whole story?

* **Ask students**: why do zebras have stripes, and why there are so many different kinds of trees? There are no right answers at this point.

### How does survival of the fittest work?

One of the best examples of 'survival of the fittest' is a certain species of moth called the Peppered Moth that lives in the United Kingdom. In the 1800s, it was almost always found in a light-coloured variety, with only a few dark-coloured moths. But then the Industrial Revolution happened, and a lot of coal soot pollution entered the environment. The trees that the moths like to live on that normally had light-coloured lichen on them got darker - they got sooty, and the lichen died off. In a period of a few decades, a dark-coloured variety of moth became much more common, almost entirely replacing the light-coloured moth!

We will do an experiment to simulate a natural population as it grows and evolves
and observe the outcome to see which will win: evolution, or chance!

## Experiment: Moran process

### Materials

* Coloured tokens in two colours for each pod (these could be anything - chits, balls, paper pieces) - 6 of each per group of two or three. We used coloured coins in green and purple.
* Dice - one die per pod
* Paper (worksheet with table to fill in) & pencil
* Environment images - trees and moths coloured purple or green, one per pod

### Objective & Procedure

Students carry out a simulation of a random walk using their coloured tokens.

* Explain the game: starting with equal number of each colour (purple and green), they roll the die repeatedly and do one of two things depending on the outcome: either a green token 'dies' and a purple token is 'born', or vice versa. They repeat this until the population is either all green or all purple, and record the number of rolls it took to get that outcome. If they are recording the number of rolls by tally, also get them to write the total after the round.
* (Optional) Pose this as a game: if you roll the die and your colour wins, then you get to roll again, if you lose, then the next person rolls.
* Split groups of 4 into two groups of 2 to play the game.
* **Ask students:** which colour do you think will win? Why?

#### Round 1

The dice probabilities are 50-50: if the number is 4-6, red dies, and if the number is 1-3, blue dies.

* Draw histrogram axes on the board where the x axis categories are 'green wins' and 'purple wins'. Ask each group to report the number of times that each colour won, and add the totals to the histogram as you go. **Ask students** what they notice about the result. Is it equal? Why or why not?
* Draw a second set of histogram axes to tally the number of rolls per trial. The x-axis should be odd numbers starting at 1 and going up to about 30. (It always takes an odd number of rolls for a colour to win.) Ask each group to report the number of rolls for each of their trials and add these to the histogram. With a group of about 20 where each group does about five trials, there should be enough statistics to see that the most common number of rolls is 3. **Ask students:** why is 3 the lowest number of rolls that was observed? (Because it takes minimum 3 rolls for a colour to win.) **Ask students:** what number is the most common? Why do you think that is? Is there anything about this graph that surprises you? (There might not be, but they're creative.)
* Circle back to the zebras - imagine we have six groups of zebras, and they can be either brown or striped and they're both equally good. Sometimes, they would all get stripes!

#### Round 2

One colour is more fit than the other. If the number is 1-4, the less fit colour dies, and if the number is 5 or 6, the more fit colour dies.

* Distribute a tree picture to each group (this can also be done before the workshop starts - tape them to the table).
* The colour of tree each group has means that the 'moths' (coins) of that colour are more likely to survive at that pod.
* **Ask students:** which colour do you think will win? Do you think it will win all the time? Why or why not?
* **Ask students:** if we make the same graph as before (the histogram with the winning colours), do you think it will look different? If so, how?
* Repeat the same procedure as in Round 1 and tally the results as before, but for the first histogam either make two histograms (one for green trees and one for purple trees) or combine into one where the x axis categories are 'tree colour' and 'opposite colour' (how many times the same colour as the tree won vs the opposite colour).
* **Ask students:** are these results different from what you expected? Why or why not?
* Refer to the histogram for trial length. **Ask students:** is the distribution of the number of rolls different from last time? If it's not clear if it's different, **ask students** how they could test it. What would convince them? (Maybe more trials, maybe trying different dice probabilities, maybe using a computer simulation.)
* **Ask students** (optional): do you think it would take longer, shorter, or the same time on average for one colour to win if we used more tokens (like 5 of each colour instead of 3)? What does this mean about real populations?

Students observe that even though one colour is 'better' than the other, it doesn't always take over in the population because of randomness.

* (Optional) show results from computer simulations of the same process with many more trials.  

### Extensions and variations

* Different population sizes - look at the amount of genetic drift as a function of population size, make a histogram
* Track the population size over time - enter in a spreadsheet the number of red at each die roll.

## Moran experiment debrief

Natural selection, or 'survival of the fittest', influences which traits increase in a population over time, but another strong influence is chance, which we saw today. Physics has helped researchers understand the role of chance in biology.

In the experiment, we knew what was happening at each time step. In the real world, we often don't have all the time steps: we look at a population at one instant in time, and we use the principles we saw at work in our experiment to give us more information about the factors at work in real-world populations.

* **Ask students:** can you think of examples of selection - traits changing over time? (i.e. dog breeds, eye colour)

We use these principles a lot to study bacteria. We use antibiotics to treat illnesses caused by bacteria, but sometimes bacteria get mutations that make them antibiotic-resistant. Understanding chance and natural selection has made it possible to predict how likely it is that that will happen, and how often it can happen in different situations. Circle back to the zebras: one reason why they have stripes might be because of randomness - maybe a zebra randomly got stripes, and it randomly took over in the populations.

An example of chance causing changes in populations is the Paradise Kingfisher, which is found on islands in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Show students the three pictures of the birds, and **ask students** what differences they can see. These birds are all closely related, but because small groups of them migrated to different islands and were isolated from the main group, chance caused some traits to turn out differently in different populations.

* **Ask students:** why do we have 5 fingers and not 4 or 6? Answer: the first thing randomly had five fingers, or maybe there were different amounts of fingers, but one randomly became fixed in the population.

### Notes and ideas

* Important point: both moth colours existed before the selection changed - selection acts on existing variation.
* Possible nice thing for the slides: make a gif of the histogram building itself as trials complete
* Making the histograms on the board at the end of each round has several benefits: because it's happening in real time and it's clear what's being counted, you never have to say the word 'histogram' or explain what that means. It also means that everyone's results matter to the group understanding, and the results are not scripted or planned - it's science!
* Other examples to consider adding to the debrief and slides:
  * extremophile bacteria and archaea (extreme selection pressures produce extreme adaptations)
  * anole lizards - an [example of both selection and chance](https://www.livescience.com/18276-lizards-show-evolution.html)
  * Mexican blind cave fish
  * suggested by a student: the "grey squirrels" here are black, because black is warmer than grey (have not confirmed that this is true)

* Handout: make the table longer, and cut them off at some point so they don't get bored by seeing that the end is near

* "One name for D-glucose (the biological isomer), is dextrose, referring to the fact that it causes linearly polarized light to rotate to the right or dexter side. In a similar manner, levulose, more commonly known as fructose, causes the plane of polarization to rotate to the left. Fructose is even more strongly levorotatory than glucose is dextrorotatory. Invert sugar syrup, commercially formed by the hydrolysis of sucrose syrup to a mixture of the component simple sugars, fructose, and glucose, gets its name from the fact that the conversion causes the direction of rotation to 'invert' from right to left." (Wikipedia)

Materials notes:

- we want each participant to be able to assemble a tetrahedral molecule with four different end groups (represented by four different coloured atoms). We could buy enough pre-made chemistry kits to allow about 30 people to make the same molecule (6 kits [like this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Organic-Chemistry-Model-Kit-239-pieces-Molecular-Model-Kit-Atoms-Bonds-Instructional-Guide-Chemistry-Model-Kit-Students-Teachers/576904262), for instance), or we could buy in bulk just the individual components that we need to make the tetrahedral molecules. For enough supplies for a 30-person group, we could buy the parts for \$95 plus about \$9 shipping at [Indigo Instruments](https://www.indigoinstruments.com/molecular_models/molymod/components/#9252). Here's a screenshot of a shopping cart that has everything we need:
